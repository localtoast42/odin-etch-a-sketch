# Etch-a-Sketch

A project for practicing DOM manipulation with JavaScript. This project was created for the Foundations course in The Odin Project.

At the start, a 4x4 grid of gray squares is presented. Move your mouse pointer over the grid to permanently change square colors from gray to black.

Click the "Generate New Grid" button at the top to refresh the grid. You will also be prompted to enter in how many squares per side the new grid will have, if you want a denser or sparser grid. The maximum allowable number of squares per side is 100.
